## üîß How It Works

### Data Flow
1. **Market Data Collection**: Fetches real-time 5-minute cryptocurrency data from Yahoo Finance
2. **Technical Analysis**: Calculates RSI and MACD indicators using the `ta` library
3. **AI Analysis**: Sends market data and indicators to Claude AI for trading recommendations
4. **Decision Making**: Compares Claude's confidence against the configured threshold
5. **Trade Execution**: Executes trades through Robinhood API (live) or paper trading simulation
6. **Data Storage**: Stores all trades and portfolio values in SQLite database

### Trading Logic
- **Buy Signal**: RSI < 30 (oversold) AND MACD histogram turning positive
- **Sell Signal**: RSI > 70 (overbought) AND MACD histogram turning negative
- **Hold**: All other conditions or insufficient confidence
- **Risk Management**: Automatic stop-loss and position sizing

### Claude AI Integration
The bot sends structured market data to Claude AI with prompts like:
```
Analyze the following cryptocurrency market data for BTC and provide a trading recommendation:

Current Market Data:
- Price: $45,230.50
- RSI: 28.5
- MACD Histogram: 0.0023
- Recent Price Trend: down

Trading Strategy: Buy when RSI is below 30 and MACD histogram is turning positive...

Please provide:
1. Action: "buy", "sell", or "hold"
2. Confidence: A number between 0.0 and 1.0
3. Reason: Brief explanation for your recommendation

Format your response as JSON:
{"action": "buy/sell/hold", "confidence": 0.0-1.0, "reason": "explanation"}
```
